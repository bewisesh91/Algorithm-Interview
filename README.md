## Data Structure
In the most basic terms, a data structure is a format for organizing data in an efficient way. In practical terms, we can split data structures into two things: the interface and the implementation.
The interface is like a contract that specifies how we can interact with the data structure - what operations we can perform on it, what inputs it expects, and what outputs we can expect.
For example, consider a dynamic array. The interface would include operations like appending, insertion, removal, updating, and more. 
These operations are well-defined and have specific rules that we must follow when we use them. 
If we want to append an element, we use the built-in method like .append() or .push() while passing in the element we want to add as an argument. 
The implementation is the code that actually makes the data structure work. 
This is where the details of how the data is stored and how the operations are performed come into play. 
For example, the implementation of a dynamic array might involve allocating memory for the list, tracking the size, and rearranging the elements when an operation like remove is called.
